# QuestHub: A Comprehensive Q&A Platform

Welcome to QuestHub, a community-driven Q&A platform inspired by the principles of Stack Overflow and built upon the learnings from "ASP.NET Core 5 and React - Second Edition" by Packt Publishing. This project is a personal endeavor, meticulously crafted to put the concepts and techniques outlined in the book into practice, while also expanding upon them with the latest technologies in ASP.NET 6 and React 18.

## Project Genesis

QuestHub is not just a codebase; it's a reflection of a journey through full-stack web development, from the foundational understanding of ASP.NET and React to the deployment of a fully-functional web application. This project is built upon the lessons learned from each chapter of the book, implementing and adapting its teachings to create a platform where knowledge is shared, questions are answered, and community engagement thrives.

## Key Features and Technologies

- **ASP.NET 8 and React 18:** Utilizing the latest versions for backend and frontend development, ensuring a modern, efficient, and scalable application.
- **TypeScript:** Enhancing development with strong typing, enabling more robust and maintainable code.
- **Emotion for Styling:** Adopting CSS-in-JS for styling components, offering a flexible and powerful way to style React components.
- **React Router:** Managing SPA navigation and routes efficiently, improving the user experience with seamless page transitions.
- **Redux for State Management:** Centralizing application state and managing it effectively across components.
- **Dapper for Data Access:** Simplifying database interactions with a lightweight ORM, enhancing performance and maintainability.
- **REST API Integration:** Designing and consuming RESTful services for dynamic data exchange between frontend and backend.
- **Security with OIDC and Auth0:** Implementing robust authentication and authorization strategies to protect resources and user data.
- **Automated Testing:** Ensuring application reliability and quality with a comprehensive suite of tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **CI/CD with Azure DevOps:** Streamlining the build, test, and deployment processes, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.

5. **Effective Navigation Management:** Utilizing React Router for SPA routing.
6. **Form Handling and Validation:** Streamlining form interactions with controlled components and React Hook Form.
7. **State Management with Redux:** Centralizing state for coherent data flow and management.
8. **Database Interactions with Dapper:** Simplifying data access with an efficient ORM.
9. **RESTful API Design:** Building and securing API endpoints for robust backend services.
10. **Performance and Scalability Enhancements:** Optimizing application performance through various strategies.
11. **Security Best Practices:** Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
12. **REST API Consumption:** Engaging with APIs for dynamic content delivery and management.
13. **Comprehensive Testing Approach:** Adopting a multi-layered testing strategy for reliability.
14. **Azure Deployment:** Configuring and deploying the application to the cloud for accessibility and scalability.
15. **Automation with CI/CD:** Implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery for efficient development workflows.

# Running QuestHub Locally

QuestHub is built with ASP.NET 6 for the backend and React 18 for the frontend. Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- .NET 6 SDK
- Node.js (Preferably the latest LTS version)
- An IDE or editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio for ASP.NET, Visual Studio Code for React)

## Running the ASP.NET 6 Backend

1. **Open the Backend Solution:**
   - In Visual Studio, navigate to the folder containing the ASP.NET project and double-click on the `.sln` file.

2. **Restore Dependencies:**
   - Right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages" to ensure all dependencies are up to date.

3. **Set the Startup Project:**
   - Right-click on the backend project and select "Set as StartUp Project."

4. **Run the Project:**
   - Click on the "IIS Express" button or press `F5` to start the project. Your default browser will open to the API's base URL.

## Running the React 18 Frontend

1. **Open the Frontend Project:**
   - Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code or your preferred editor.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Open a terminal and run the following command:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

3. **Start the React App:**
   - Once dependencies are installed, start the app with:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - The app will open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running Both Projects Together

For full functionality, both the backend and frontend should be running simultaneously. Start the backend first to ensure it's ready to handle requests from the frontend.

## Additional Configuration

Check your project's specific configurations, such as environment variables and database connections, to ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend.


## Acknowledgments
